    <h3>My Journey Into Web Development</h3>

    <p>
        Hello! My name is Shadrack, and this is my very first website.  
        I built it as part of my learning journey into HTML and web development.
        This page represents the beginning of something big for me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Creating this website has helped me understand how webpages are structured, 
        and it marks the start of my personal portfolio. As I grow as a developer, 
        I will continue updating and improving it.
    </p>

    <p>
        My goal is to eventually build advanced web applications, but every expert 
        starts somewhere — and this is my starting point. I am excited about what is ahead.

        Below is a clickable image that links to one of my favorite sites.  
        It also serves as practice for embedding images and adding links in HTML.
