        <h3>My Journey Into Web Development</h3>

        <p>Hello! My name is Shadrack, and this is my very first website.
           I built it as part of my learning journey into HTML and web development.
           This page represents the beginning of something big for me.</p>

        <p>Creating this website has helped me understand how webpages are structured,
           and it marks the start of my personal portfolio. As I grow as a developer,
           I will continue updating and improving it.</p>

        <p>My goal is to eventually build advanced web applications, but every expert
           starts somewhere — and this is my starting point. I am excited about what is ahead.</p>

        <p>Below is a clickable image that links to one of my favorite sites.</p>
